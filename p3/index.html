          <h3>Welcome to the World of Tabletop RPGs</h3>
          <p>This site is designed for anyone who has an interest in tabletop RPGs. Learn about the universe of roleplaying games such as Dungeons & Dragons and the essential things you will need to start playing, discover the right games for your group, and get advice on how to improve your gaming sessions.</p>

          <h4>What You Need to Get Started</h4>
          <p>While it helps to have a large number of things, like your dice, a copy of the rulebooks, minis, and more, typically all you need is a pen and sheet of paper for your character sheet.</p>
          <p>Rulebooks can be borrowed (or read for free online, the most popular games tend to provide the core rules at least legally for free online via websites like d20srd.org for D&D or AONprd.com for Pathfinder) and so can dice, but you do need a way to write down your character.</p>
          <p>The only hard and fast rule is that someone in the group needs to know the rules or have easy access to them, and also someone needs to own a set with at least one of each kind of die. Everything else is negotiable.</p>

            <h5>Dice</h5>

            <p>7 mystical shapes link your decisions to your character's fate.  As the dice fall from your hand, your character boldly advances.  Roll with the Best!</p>
            <p>Dungeons and Dragons made these seven dice an unstoppable team.  Use of a "D&D dice" set is common to most tabletop role playing games today.</p>
            <p>You might be wondering:</p>
            <p>Which 7 dice make a set?</p>
            <p>To start playing, you only need one of each: the D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20, but standard 7-dice sets also include a second D10 which is used for percentile rolls.  Gamers often prefer to have multiples of some die in order to roll pools of dice, such as 3D6 in one roll instead of 3 individual rolls.
            <p>â€‹But what are their common uses?</p>
            <p>In general, the D4, D6, D8, D10 and D12 are used for weapons damage, attacks, spells and healing amounts.  The D20 is used most often, to see if your attempted action succeeds.</p>

            <h6>Miniature Figures</h6>
            <img src="mini.png">
            <p>In miniature wargaming, players enact simulated battles using scale models called miniature models, which can be anywhere from 2mm to 54mm in height, to represent warriors, vehicles, artillery, buildings, and terrain. These models are colloquially referred to as miniatures or minis.</p>
            <p>Miniature models are commonly made of metal, plastic, or paper. They are used to augment the visual aspects of a game and track position, facing, and line of sight of characters. Miniatures are typically painted and can be
            artfully sculpted, making them collectible in their own right. Pre-painted plastic figures, such as Clix miniatures produced by WizKids, have also become popular. The hobby of painting, collecting, and playing with
            miniatures originated with toy soldiers, though the latter were generally sold pre-painted.</p>

            <h7>Character Sheet</h7>
            <img src="character sheet.png">
            <p>A character sheet is a record of a player character in a role-playing game, including whatever details, notes, game statistics, and background information a player would need during a play session. Character sheets can be found in use in both traditional and action
            role-playing games. Almost all roleplaying games make use of character sheets in some fashion; even "rules-light" systems and freeform role-playing games record
            character details in some manner.</p>
